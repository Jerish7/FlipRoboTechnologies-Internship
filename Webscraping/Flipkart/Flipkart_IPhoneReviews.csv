Doesn't seem bulky with decent touch and camera. The ""standard maintained"" quality of IPhone. Go for it, if your budget is not more enough for pro models.

26,5,Wonderful,This is my first ever I phone. Before this I was using my google nexus 5. But moving from android to iOS is a great experience. It‚Äôs worth at this price.

You guys have more or less better gadget. 2) If you are an android user and planning to buy premium phone. I will suggest them to please buy iPhone instead of buying an Android.

Also if you play that game for 10 mins the brightness will be automatically down due to over heating even when the auto brightness is set to off. This will not be solved even if u manually increase the bri...

44,5,Just wow!,Best in class. Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures.
